A type-hinted async Telegram bot library.

Roboto's API is not perfectly stable nor complete yet. It will be kept a 0.x.0
until the Telegram Bot API is completely implemented, and will be bumped to
1.0.0 when it is complete.


Basic usage
===========

Roboto is still a low-level bot API, meaning it does not provide much
abstraction over the Bot API yet (that is planned, though).

Currently, a basic echo bot with roboto looks like:

```python
from roboto import Token, BotAPI

from asyncio import run


api_token = Token('your-bot-token')


async def main() -> None:
    bot = BotAPI(api_token)

    offset = 0

    while True:
        updates = await bot.get_updates(offset)

        for update in updates:
            if update.message is not None and update.message.text is not None:
                await bot.send_message(
                    update.message.chat.id,
                    update.message.text,
                )

        if updates:
            offset = updates[-1].update_id + 1

run(main())
```

Being statically-typed, Roboto supports easy autocompletion and `mypy` static
checking.


Goals
=====

Principles
----------

- Ease of static checking for client code, especially static typing.
- Forwards compatibility (additions to the bot HTTP API should not break older
  versions of Roboto easily).

Next milestones
---------------

- [ ] Full Telegram Bot API implementation.
- [ ] High-level API (abstraction for command handlers, necessary internal
      state, etc.).
- [ ] Support for other async runtimes other than asyncio (especially
      [`trio`](https://github.com/python-trio/trio)).
